First, we need to install the `framer-motion` and `react-router-dom` libraries. We can do this with the following commands:

```shell
npm install framer-motion
npm install react-router-dom
```

Next, we need to create a new React app. We can do this with the following command:

```shell
npx create-react-app framer-motion-page-transitions
```

Once the app is created, we need to add the `AnimatePresence` component to the `App.js` file. This component will ensure that our animations are only rendered when they're visible.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { HashRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import { AnimatePresence } from "framer-motion";

export default function App(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <HashRouter>
      <AnimatePresence mode="wait">
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
          {/*add more route here*/}
        </Routes>
      </AnimatePresence>
    </HashRouter>
  );
}
```

## Creating the Animation

Now, we need to create the animation. We'll do this by creating a new component called `AnimatedView.tsx`. This component will take a child component and add an animation to it.

```tsx
import { LazyMotion, m, domAnimation } from "framer-motion";

export default function AnimationPage({ children }: any): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <LazyMotion features={domAnimation}>
      <m.div
        initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
        exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
        transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
      >
        {children}
      </m.div>
    </LazyMotion>
  );
}
```

This code will create an animation that fades the child component in and out over a duration of 0.5 seconds.

### Wrapping the Pages

The final step is to wrap all of our pages in the `AnimatedView` component. We can do this by updating the `Home.js` file to the following:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { AnimationPage } from "AnimatedView";

export default function Home(): JSX.Element {
  return <AnimationPage>{/*code for home page*/}</AnimationPage>;
}
```

Now, when we navigate to different pages in our app, they will be animated in and out.

## Conclusion

That's it! We've now learned how to add page transition animation in React Router with Framer Motion in very low JavaScript. By using the `LazyMotion` component, we were able to reduce the size of the JavaScript for more than 50%.
