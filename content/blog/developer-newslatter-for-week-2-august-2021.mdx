## Vue 3.2 promises a speed boost 🚀

Vue 3.2, a new release of the popular JavaScript framework, offers better performance as well as improvements to single file components and web components. Vue 3.2 was announced on August 5.

For web components, Vue 3.2 introduces a **defineCustomElement** method to create native custom elements using Vue component APIs. Developers can build Vue-powered UI component libraries that can be used with any framework or no framework at all.

## Github.dev is now live 📺

from now [github.dev](https://github.dev) is live 🚀 so you can check it out. as you know Github plans to provide there own codespaces, so you can write code from your browser and save it into you github repo online from anywhare you want.

### What is a codespace?

A codespace is a development environment thats hosted in the cloud. You can customize your project for Codespaces by committing configuration files to your repository (often known as Configuration-as-Code), which creates a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project.

Codespaces run on a variety of VM-based compute options hosted by GitHub, that you can configure from 2 core machines up to 32 core machines. You can connect to your codespaces from the browser or locally using Visual Studio Code.

## Visual Studio 2022 Preview 3 shines on JavaScript, TypeScript, Git

With the third preview of Microsoft’s planned 64-bit Visual Studio 2022 IDE, the company is emphasizing a new JavaScript/TypeScript experience as well as multi-repo support.

Unveiled August 10, Visual Studio 2022 Preview 3 also covers themes including personal and team productivity. For JavaScript and TypeScript, the preview offers tools to enhance the experience for single-page applications and front-end development. A new JavaScript/TypeScript project will enable developers to build standalone Angular, React, and Vue projects. Visual Studio will leverage each JavaScript framework’s native CLIs to front-end project templates. The IDE will discover the version of the CLI installed on the developer’s path to scaffold the project.

## What I Find Interesting 😱

after searching for many other this i find something that really Interesting & scary. here take a look at what i find.

### OpenAI 🤖 Is Making Coding As Easy As Talking to a Smart Speaker

Plus: The early days of programming, an existential investigation, and bipartisanship before our very eyes.

as you know that **github copilet** uses **OpenAI** to write code by using pridictions, after that OpenAI try to create programs like Alexa that can write code by just telling them what to do [more](https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-open-ai-codex/).

### GitHub’s 🐱 Commercial AI Tool Was Built From Open Source Code

Copilot is pitched as a helpful aid to developers. But some programmers object to the blind copying of blocks of code used to train the algorithm [more](https://www.wired.com/story/github-commercial-ai-tool-built-open-source-code/).

### AI 🤖 Could Soon Write Code Based on Ordinary Language

researchers have used artificial intelligence to improve translation between programming languages or automatically fix problems. The AI system DrRepair, for example, has been shown to solve most issues that spawn error messages. But some researchers dream of the day when AI can write programs based on simple descriptions from non-experts [more](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-write-code-ordinary-language/)..

### The JavaScript Framework That Puts Web Pages on a Diet

**Svelte**, created by a graphics editor for The New York Times, has attracted a following among programmers
who want their pages to load faster.
