I recently watched a movie called "**The Imitation Game**," which told the story of **Alan Turing**, a brilliant mind who invented the first computer. His passion for his work got me thinking about why math is so important when it comes to understanding machines.

Right now, I'm in the process of teaching myself computer programming. I'm exploring different languages like React and NextJS, which are handy for business-related challenges. However, I'm eager to do more than that. I want to contribute to solving significant problems in the world, like creating rockets.

My educational journey took a different route after completing 9th grade, and for the past five years, I've been learning on my own. Inspired by Turing, I've decided to forge my own path without going to college, believing that formal education isn't the only way to gain knowledge.

Next on my list is learning math. I believe it's a key ingredient for problem-solving. Once I've got a good grasp of it, I plan to tackle problems, whether they're related to programming or math. My goal is to use these skills to make a positive impact on the world.

I'd like to express my gratitude to Alan Turing for being an inspiration. This journey is more than just about acquiring knowledge; it's about using that knowledge to make the world a better place.
